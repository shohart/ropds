# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project follows [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Added
- One-shot scans accept `--force` (`ropds --scan --force`) to re-read every archive even when its size and mtime are unchanged.

### Fixed
- `library.zip_codepage` is now applied when scanning and serving books from ZIP archives: entries whose names are not flagged as UTF-8 are decoded with the configured codepage instead of CP437, so books with non-English names can be downloaded, read, and have covers extracted. If names were already stored as mojibake, run one scan with `--force` to correct them.

## [0.11.6] - 2026.07.30

### Fixed
- Book cards no longer overflow on narrow screens when a book has a long genre name: genre badges now wrap inside the card instead of making the whole page horizontally scrollable.

## [0.11.5] - 2026.05.27

### Added
- A German (Deutsch) interface locale is now bundled alongside English and Russian. The language selector lists every available locale automatically and labels each one with its native name.

### Fixed
- Adding a new interface language no longer requires source-code changes. Dropping a translated TOML file into the `locales/` directory is enough — the web language selector, OPDS language facet, and runtime fallback all pick it up automatically. The README documents the streamlined process in both English and Russian.

## [0.11.4] - 2026.05.26

### Added
- A new `opds.alphabet_first_word_only` configuration option restricts the alphabet drill-down for Books, Authors, and Series to match only the first word of each name. The default keeps the existing behaviour, which matches the typed letters at any word boundary.

## [0.11.3] - 2026.05.25

### Added
- The Catalogs page now shows a persistent ".." entry at the top of each list, providing one-click navigation back to the parent folder just like a regular file browser.
- A breadcrumb bar in the Catalogs view lets you jump back to any level of the hierarchy, with a clickable home icon for the root.
- Each catalog entry now displays a book-count badge so it is immediately clear how many books are inside.

### Changed
- The Catalogs page surfaces books living directly at the library root instead of hiding them behind a nameless folder. The filesystem root is presented as a "Books" virtual folder; when it is the only top-level entry, its contents are shown at the root view, and when other top-level catalogs exist it is pinned to the top of the listing.

## [0.11.2] - 2026.05.12

### Fixed
- Completed the letter drill-down fix from 0.11.1 for the web interface: clicking the final letter group for authors or series now lists only entries whose name has a word starting with the chosen letters, instead of falling back to a substring match.

## [0.11.1] - 2026.05.12

### Fixed
- Letter drill-down for authors, series, and book titles now matches the typed letters at the start of any word in the name, not just the start of the full string. Both the per-letter counts and the resulting listings reflect this, so entries such as "Hakim Abdul Efendi" are reachable under the "AB" group.

## [0.11.0] - 2026.05.07

### Added
- Added offline reading support for recently opened books in the PWA.
- Added an offline library page and offline-tolerant reading progress sync.

## [0.10.6] - 2026.04.20

This release closes [issue #3](https://github.com/dshein-alt/ropds/issues/3).

### Added
- Added configurable database connection pool sizing, with updated example configs for SQLite, PostgreSQL, and MySQL deployments.

### Fixed
- Improved EPUB and FB2 metadata and cover parsing for books that use non-UTF XML encodings.

## [0.10.5] - 2026.04.17

### Added
- Official multi-architecture Docker images (linux/amd64, linux/arm64) are now published to GitHub Container Registry and Docker Hub on every release.
- Release pages now include ready-to-use compose files, config examples, and a sample `.env` so users can deploy ROPDS without cloning the repository. See [docker/README.md](docker/README.md) for the standalone deployment flow.

### Changed
- The `docker-compose.*.yml` files now default to pulling the published image instead of building from source; the library-mount default is now `./library` relative to the compose file.

## [0.10.4] - 2026.04.17
